# AB-Testing-project

Study goals: Cecking and analyzing A/B test results for an online store.

Before quitting, my predecessor launched an A/B test for testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system. I have the test data, and my task is to see whether it was carried out correctly, and analyze the results.
